One-Way Binding
---------------
    The modified propery value is immediately updated on the user interface, but a change in the
    control does not update the property value.

    (example)
    <p>{{propertyName}}</p>

Two-Way Binding
---------------
    Any changes on the property or control causes a change in the other.

    (example)
    <input [(ngModel)]='name' type=text/>
