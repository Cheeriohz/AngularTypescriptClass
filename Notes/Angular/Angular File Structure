Importing Classes
-----------------
    All files in Angular contain a class that has been exported.
    To use one class in another class, the class must be imported which references:
        The file containing the class.
        The classname itself (in curly braces)
    File path is relative to the path of the current file

Decorators
----------
    Decorators provide meta-data about the object
    All decorators begin with an at sign (@)
    The decorator defines the object type
    Most decorators take parameters, but unused parameters need not be specified
    Decorators take a JSON object as a parameters
    Never add a semicolon at the end of a decorator 

    (Example)
    @Component({
        selector: "abc-comp",
        templateUrl: "./abc.component.html",
        styleUrls: []
    })
    export class AbcComponent{ .. }
