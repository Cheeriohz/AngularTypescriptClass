    Components - These are specific items that control a piece of the UI
    Services - These are sharable by front end and back end.
    Pipes - Post ?
    Directives: Structural and Attribute - These are definable modular elements (high reusability)

Angular 1x vs 2x
    There were issues with 1x with scalability. Therefore google decided to get ahead of future
    issues in size creep by branching out into and entirely new framework.  There was no easy 
    and quick way to transition from 1x to 2x. 
    
    Angular 2x (from here on Angular) uses fragments or views. It doesn't use entire HTML pages. 
    Nearly every piece of code in angular is a class.

    Angular is a component based framework. compnents are completely self-contained units that 
    control a portion of the web page. Components are organized intoa  tree-like structure with 
    a  root component and all other components branching from the root or from other components.
