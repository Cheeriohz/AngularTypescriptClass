A module is an object in Angular that groups logically connected components, services, and other modules.
All UI objects must belong to a module.
All Applications have a root module.
All modules are marked with @NgModule decorator with data:
    declarations: component class names
    imports: module class names
    providers: service class names
    bootstrap: startup component


Reference
---------
    @NgModule

    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'
    
    @NgModule({
        declarations: [..],
        imports: [..],
        providers: [..],
        bootstrap: [..]
    })
    export class AppModule {..}


Modules almost never contain code and are almost exclusively used to group other objects
