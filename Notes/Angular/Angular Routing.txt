Overview
--------
    Routing is the process where the URL is used as data for displaying the appropriate component
    Components are injected into HTML containing the special psuedo-HTML tags <router-outlet></router-outlet>
        In SPA, components are rendered here.
        Can exist in multiple components, but should be visible in only one at a time.
    Requires a module to define the routes and the components associated with each route
    Order of routes is significant
    For debugging, you can optionally include an additional parameter in your module imports to ask how Angular determined a route

routerLink
----------
    A special Angular attribute for <a> tags to programmatically link to a different component by route.
    Used instead of href (href can be used but will refresh the application [postback?])

    (example)
    <a routerLink='/about'>Go To About</a>

routerLinkActive
----------------
    Attribute identifying a CSS class to apply when the link has been selected

    (example)
    <a routerLink='/about' routerLinkActive='font-color-yellow'>...</a>

Route
-----
    Each route defines which component to load based on the info in the address line of the browser
    path: defines the route (without leading slash)
    component: the class name of the component to load.

    (example)
    { path: 'app', component: AppComponent }

Route path at startup
---------------------
    There is a special path used to handle the application start-up when no specific route information is provided
    path: empty string (no route)
    redirectTo: link to normal URL
    pathMatch: look at the entire path
    Must be first path defined.

    (example)
    { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'},

Catch-all route path
--------------------
    There is a special path used to handle routes not mapped
    path: double asterisks (**)
    component: any imported component
    Must be last path defined.

    (example)
    { path: '**', component: AppComponent }

Example Router Module
---------------------
    import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
    import { HomeComponent } from './home.component';
    import { GetComponent } from './get.component';

    const routes; Routes[] [
        { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'},
        { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
        { path: 'get/:id', component: HomeComponent },
        { path: '**', component: HomeComponent }
    ];

    @NgModule({
        imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(routes) ],
        exports: [ RouterModule ]
    })
    export class AppRouterModule {}
